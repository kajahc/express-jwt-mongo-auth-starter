# Preview
This game is modeled after the tv show. There are six categories which contain five questions each valuing from 200 points to 1000 points.
# Technology used:
We used javascript, css and html.
We used a locally stored image for the background.
Command line - used to create repository structure
Source Control
wireframe.cc - use make website diagrams
VS Code - used for coding
Google Chrome web browser - used to launch website
Google Chrome Developer Tools - used to debug issues
# Approach:
The main approach was to get the questions, answers and point values into the database then to see if we could connect the frontend with the backend.
# How I solved for the winner:
The winner is determined by looping through the array of questions answered and marking the points earned for the User. After the final question, the total sum of points will be calculated and the User with the most points wins.
#Main features:
The point value of the questions.
# Future ideas:
To alert the user if the question was correct or incorrect
To keep count of who won each game (best 2 out of 3)
Add a brief pause after a click, then show the answer
Make the game multiplayer
# What I learned:
How to make routes for the database
There are almost infinite ways to accomplish the same task (everyone's code is different, no two codes are the same)
querySelector
How think out format and styling
The most difficult part was working through the game logic.
